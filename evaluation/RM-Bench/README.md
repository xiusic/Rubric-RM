# RM-Bench

This repository contains the data of the ICLR 24 Oral Paper "*RM-Bench: Benchmarking Reward Models of Language Models with Subtlety and Style*"

## Introduction
We introduce RM-Bench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating reward models of language modeling.
We focus on two aspects of reward models: **Sensitivity to Subtle Changes** and **Robustness to Style Bias**.
Specifically, for each prompt in RM-Bench, we provide three chosen responses and three rejected responses with different styles.
The difference between the chosen and rejected responses is subtle, and the styles of the responses are varied from concise to detailed to well-formatted.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: Example Data from RMBench. The rejected response incorrect because Schrödinger's cat illustrates the concept of quantum superposition, not quantum entanglement.
$y^\varnothing$ is a concise response, $y^{\text{L}}$ is a detailed response, and $y^{\text{L,M}}$ is a detailed response with markdown formatting.

## Dataset Details
The dataset can be found in the `data` directory or downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THU-KEG/RM-Bench).
The samples are formatted as follows:

```json
{
    "id": // unique identifier of the sample,
    "prompt": // the prompt given to the model,
    "chosen": [
        "resp_1", // the chosen response with concise style,
        "resp_2", // the chosen response with detailed style and formatted as plain text,
        "resp_3" // the chosen response with detailed style and formatted as markdown,
    ]
    "rejected": [
        "resp_1", // the rejected response with concise style,
        "resp_2", // the rejected response with detailed style and formatted as plain text,
        "resp_3" // the rejected response with detailed style and formatted as markdown,
    ],
    "domain": // the domain of the sample including "chat, code, math, safety-refuse, safety-response"
}
```

## Evaluation

Our codebase is largely based on the [Reward Bench](https://github.com/allenai/reward-bench/)
Thus for the environment setup, you may follow the instructions in the [Reward Bench Setup](https://github.com/allenai/reward-bench/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-usage).
After git clone the repository, you can run the following command to evaluate the reward model on RM-Bench:
```bash
bash run_rm.sh # for sequence-classification reward model
bash run_dpo.sh # for DPO model as reward model
```


## how to compute the accuracy

The accuracy is computed by comparing scores of chosen responses and rejected responses iteratively. 
The detailed code is provided in `scripts/utils.py`.
Here is a quick example of how to compute the accuracy:
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict, Any
def compute_accuracy(results: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    # results is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following keys:
    # score_chosen: [float, float, float], the scores of the chosen responses
    # score_rejected: [float, float, float], the scores of the rejected responses
    # the scores are in the order of [concise, detailed_plain, detailed_markdown]
    # we will compare the scores of chosen responses and rejected responses iteratively
    # formatted as a 3x3 matrix, where the rows represent the scores of chosen responses
    # and the columns represent the scores of rejected responses
    MATRIX_SIZE = 3 # the column and row size of the matrix
    acc_matrix = np.zeros((MATRIX_SIZE, MATRIX_SIZE))
    for result in results:
        for i in range(len(result["score_chosen"])):
            for j in range(len(result["score_rejected"])):
                if result["score_chosen"][i] > result["score_rejected"][j]:
                    acc_matrix[i][j] += 1
    
    # compute the accuracy by dividing the number of correct comparisons by the total number of comparisons
    acc_matrix /= len(results)
    # compute the hard,normal,easy accuracy
    # hard accuracy: the average of the upper-right triangle of the matrix
    # namely chosen responses with less fancy style compared to rejected responses with more fancy style
    upper_right_count = MATRIX_SIZE * (MATRIX_SIZE - 1) / 2
    hard_acc = np.sum(np.triu(acc_matrix, 1)) / upper_right_count
    # normal accuracy: the average of the diagonal of the matrix
    # namely chosen responses with the same style compared to rejected responses with the same style
    normal_acc = np.mean(np.diag(acc_matrix))
    # easy accuracy: the average of the lower-left triangle of the matrix
    # namely chosen responses with more fancy style compared to rejected responses with less fancy style
    lower_left_count = MATRIX_SIZE * (MATRIX_SIZE - 1) / 2
    easy_acc = np.sum(np.tril(acc_matrix, -1)) / lower_left_count
    
    return {
        "hard_acc": hard_acc,
        "normal_acc": normal_acc,
        "easy_acc": easy_acc
    }
```
